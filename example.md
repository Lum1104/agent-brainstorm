**Type:** Research Paper


## Stage 1: Context & Team

### Research Context

**Web Search Summary:**
This text covers four distinct but related topics: multimodal emotion recognition, large language models (LLMs), multi-agent systems (MAS), and collaboration. Multimodal emotion recognition is the process of identifying human emotions from various indicators, including facial expressions, verbal cues, and physiological signals, and is gaining traction in AI for human-computer interaction. LLMs are AI algorithms employing neural networks to process and generate human language, driving the generative AI boom, and are increasingly used in content creation and customer service. MAS are computer systems where multiple independent agents collaborate or compete in a shared environment to achieve goals, addressing complex and decentralized tasks, with current research exploring their application alongside LLMs. Collaboration, a dynamic process of working together towards a common goal, is deemed essential in modern workplaces for enhancing creativity, problem-solving, and productivity, with a focus on both top-down and employee-driven approaches.

**Uploaded Document Context:**
The paper introduces Emotion-LLaMA, a novel multimodal large language model designed for emotion recognition and reasoning, addressing limitations of existing MLLMs in integrating audio and recognizing subtle facial micro-expressions. To facilitate this, the authors created the MERR dataset, comprising 28,618 coarse-grained and 4,487 fine-grained annotated samples across diverse emotional categories. Emotion-LLaMA integrates audio, visual, and textual inputs through emotion-specific encoders, aligning features in a shared space and employing a modified LLaMA model with instruction tuning. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Emotion-LLaMA outperforms other MLLMs, achieving state-of-the-art results on the EMER, MER2023, MER2024, and DFEW datasets. The model incorporates HuBERT for audio processing and multiview visual encoders (MAE, VideoMAE, EVA) to capture facial details, dynamics, and context. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each component, including the MERR dataset instructions and various encoders. The authors have made their dataset and code available to facilitate further research.

## Stage 2: Divergent Ideation

### All Generated Ideas (Pre-Filtering)


#### Idea 1

- **Research Question:** Can a multi-agent system comprised of Emotion-LLaMA and LLM agents specializing in different cultural contexts improve the cross-cultural generalizability of emotion recognition, addressing the limitations of current datasets that are often biased towards Western expressions?

- **Methodology:** Develop LLM agents trained on emotion expression data from diverse cultural backgrounds. Implement a mechanism for these agents to provide context and interpretation to Emotion-LLaMA when processing emotional cues from individuals of different cultures. Evaluate performance on a newly created cross-cultural emotion recognition dataset.

- **Contribution:** A multi-agent framework that enhances the cross-cultural generalizability of emotion recognition, leading to more inclusive and accurate systems.

- **Rationale:** **AI Ethics Researcher**: Emotion recognition models often fail to generalize across cultures due to inherent biases in training data, and a multi-agent approach incorporating culturally-aware agents is crucial for addressing this critical limitation.
**Multimodal Machine Learning Researcher**: Addressing cultural bias in emotion recognition is crucial for creating fair and globally applicable systems, and a multi-agent approach offers a promising way to incorporate cultural context and improve generalization across diverse populations.

- **ðŸ”¥ Red Team Critique:** The assumption that simply training LLMs on culture-specific data automatically translates to genuine 'cultural understanding' is dubious. How will the system avoid perpetuating stereotypes or superficial interpretations of cultural nuances? Furthermore, creating a truly representative cross-cultural dataset is a monumental task prone to its own biases and practical limitations.


#### Idea 2

- **Research Question:** How can a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, incorporating Emotion-LLaMA as a key component, be used to dynamically adapt the weights and contributions of different modalities (audio, visual, text) based on the specific context and individual characteristics, leading to personalized and more accurate emotion recognition?

- **Methodology:** Develop a reinforcement learning environment where multiple agents, each responsible for processing a specific modality or providing contextual information, learn to optimize their contributions to Emotion-LLaMA's emotion recognition process based on feedback signals. Evaluate the performance on a dataset of individuals with varying demographic characteristics and emotional expression styles.

- **Contribution:** A personalized emotion recognition system that dynamically adapts to individual differences and contextual factors, improving accuracy and reducing bias.

- **Rationale:** **AI Ethics Researcher**: Individual variations in emotional expression necessitate personalized approaches, and reinforcement learning offers a powerful tool for dynamically adapting to these differences and mitigating potential biases related to demographic characteristics.
**Distributed Systems Engineer**: While reinforcement learning can be difficult to make stable, it opens the door to create self-adapting systems. The different modalities can be automatically weighted by the system, rather than hand-tuned.


#### Idea 3

- **Research Question:** How can Emotion-LLaMA be adapted to facilitate emotion-aware task delegation in multi-agent collaborative systems, optimizing for both efficiency and user well-being?

- **Methodology:** Design a system where Emotion-LLaMA analyzes the emotional states of agents (simulated or human) during task execution. Develop algorithms for dynamic task reassignment based on detected emotional states (e.g., frustration, stress) to improve individual and group performance.

- **Contribution:** A novel task delegation framework that considers emotional factors, leading to more effective and emotionally supportive collaborative environments.

- **Rationale:** **AI Ethics Researcher**: Understanding and responding to emotional cues can significantly improve the effectiveness and satisfaction of collaborative work, but task delegation strategies must be carefully designed to avoid reinforcing existing power imbalances or biases.
**Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) Specialist**: Emotion-aware task delegation can lead to improved team dynamics and performance by reducing stress and optimizing individual contributions, a key area for improving collaborative systems.
**Multimodal Machine Learning Researcher**: Integrating emotion recognition into task delegation can optimize not only efficiency but also user well-being, creating more human-centered collaborative systems, a key area of interest in my research.


#### Idea 4

- **Research Question:** What are the optimal interaction paradigms for integrating Emotion-LLaMA's emotion recognition capabilities into a collaborative design environment to enhance team creativity and reduce conflict?

- **Methodology:** Develop a collaborative design platform that uses Emotion-LLaMA to provide real-time feedback on team members' emotional responses to design proposals. Implement features that promote constructive dialogue and conflict resolution based on emotion analysis.

- **Contribution:** Guidelines for designing emotion-aware collaborative design tools that foster creativity and minimize interpersonal conflict.

- **Rationale:** **AI Ethics Researcher**: Emotional awareness in design teams can mitigate biases and promote more inclusive and innovative solutions, but the design of feedback mechanisms is critical to ensure fairness and avoid unintended consequences.
**Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) Specialist**: Understanding emotional responses during collaborative design can improve the creative process and mitigate potential conflicts, leading to more successful design outcomes.

- **ðŸ”¥ Red Team Critique:** Defining 'optimal' is problematic. Whose definition of creativity and conflict reduction are we using? The system risks imposing a normative emotional state, potentially stifling diverse perspectives and genuine disagreement which can be crucial for innovation. The ethical implications of covertly analyzing and acting upon team members' emotions are also significant and largely unaddressed.


#### Idea 5

- **Research Question:** How does the performance of Emotion-LLaMA in recognizing and responding to emotions during multi-agent collaboration vary across different cultural contexts, and what adaptations are necessary to ensure cross-cultural sensitivity?

- **Methodology:** Conduct cross-cultural studies to evaluate Emotion-LLaMA's performance in recognizing and responding to emotions in collaborative scenarios involving participants from diverse cultural backgrounds. Develop adaptation strategies to account for cultural differences in emotional expression and interpretation.

- **Contribution:** A culturally sensitive emotion recognition and response system that promotes effective and equitable collaboration across diverse teams.

- **Rationale:** **AI Ethics Researcher**: Cultural variations in emotional expression necessitate careful consideration when designing emotion-aware collaborative systems, and rigorous cross-cultural evaluation is essential to identify and mitigate potential biases.
**Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) Specialist**: Addressing cultural variations in emotional expression is crucial for creating inclusive and effective emotion-aware collaborative systems that work for diverse user groups.

- **ðŸ”¥ Red Team Critique:** The research assumes that Emotion-LLaMA can 'respond' to emotions in a meaningful way. Is it simply mimicking culturally appropriate responses, or does it possess genuine understanding? The methodology relies on cross-cultural studies, which are notoriously difficult to design and interpret due to confounding variables. Defining and measuring 'cross-cultural sensitivity' in an AI system is also vague and open to subjective interpretation.


#### Idea 6

- **Research Question:** How can a collaborative learning approach, where multiple Emotion-LLaMA agents trained on different subsets of the MERR dataset and other emotion datasets, improve the model's generalization ability and reduce bias across diverse demographic groups and emotional expressions?

- **Methodology:** Train multiple Emotion-LLaMA agents on different, possibly overlapping, subsets of the MERR dataset and other publicly available emotion datasets. Implement a federated learning or knowledge distillation approach to allow the agents to share knowledge and improve their individual performance without sharing raw data. Evaluate the ensemble's performance on a held-out test set with diverse demographic representation.

- **Contribution:** A robust and unbiased emotion recognition model achieved through collaborative learning among multiple Emotion-LLaMA agents, addressing the critical issue of fairness and generalization in emotion AI.

- **Rationale:** **AI Ethics Researcher**: Collaborative learning can mitigate bias and improve generalization by exposing the model to a wider range of emotional expressions and demographic groups, promoting a more equitable and reliable system, provided the data subsets are carefully curated to address existing biases.
**Multimodal Machine Learning Researcher**: Collaborative learning offers a promising avenue for mitigating bias and improving generalization, as it allows the model to learn from a more diverse range of data without directly exposing sensitive information, aligning with my interest in robust and ethical AI systems.

- **ðŸ”¥ Red Team Critique:** Collaborative learning doesn't magically erase bias. If the initial datasets are biased, simply splitting and recombining them through federated learning won't necessarily solve the problem. The approach might just distribute the bias more evenly. Furthermore, the MERR dataset itself has known limitations and biases, so relying heavily on it raises concerns about the generalizability of the results.


#### Idea 7

- **Research Question:** Can a hierarchical multi-agent system, where Emotion-LLaMA acts as a central coordinator delegating tasks to specialized LLM agents (e.g., context analyzer, micro-expression detector, tone analyzer), enhance the model's contextual understanding and fine-grained emotion recognition capabilities?

- **Methodology:** Design a hierarchical MAS where Emotion-LLaMA first analyzes the input and then assigns specific sub-tasks to specialized LLM agents. The agents' outputs are then aggregated by Emotion-LLaMA to generate a final emotion prediction with detailed contextual explanations. Evaluate on the fine-grained emotion categories of the MERR dataset and compare performance to the original Emotion-LLaMA.

- **Contribution:** A framework for integrating specialized LLM agents into Emotion-LLaMA to improve contextual understanding and enable more nuanced emotion recognition, moving beyond coarse-grained classifications.

- **Rationale:** **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) Specialist**: Exploring hierarchical architectures allows us to decompose the complex task of emotion recognition into smaller, more manageable sub-tasks, potentially leading to more accurate and nuanced understanding of user emotions.
**Multimodal Machine Learning Researcher**: This hierarchical approach allows for a more structured integration of specialized knowledge, mimicking the way humans process emotions by breaking down the problem into sub-tasks, potentially leading to more accurate and explainable emotion recognition.

- **ðŸ”¥ Red Team Critique:** The proposed architecture is complex, increasing the risk of overfitting and making it difficult to pinpoint the source of any performance improvements (or failures). The assumption that simply adding more specialized agents automatically leads to better 'contextual understanding' is questionable. How are the agents' outputs integrated and weighted? The system's explainability may also suffer, making it difficult to understand why certain emotions are predicted.


#### Idea 8

- **Research Question:** How can a negotiation-based multi-agent system, where Emotion-LLaMA agents representing different emotional perspectives (e.g., happiness, sadness, anger) negotiate to resolve conflicting emotion cues in multimodal data, improve the model's ability to handle complex and ambiguous emotional expressions?

- **Methodology:** Design a multi-agent system where each agent is trained to recognize a specific emotion. When presented with ambiguous multimodal data, the agents engage in a negotiation process, exchanging evidence and arguments to support their respective emotional interpretations. A negotiation protocol (e.g., argumentation, game theory) is used to reach a consensus on the most likely emotional state. Evaluate the system's performance on multimodal datasets with ambiguous or conflicting emotional cues.

- **Contribution:** A novel approach to handling emotional ambiguity by simulating emotional reasoning and negotiation among multiple agents, leading to more accurate and nuanced emotion recognition in complex scenarios.

- **Rationale:** **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) Specialist**: By modeling emotions as independent agents that 'negotiate,' we can create a system that is more robust to ambiguity and capable of capturing the complexities of human emotional expression, leading to more human-like interactions.
**Multimodal Machine Learning Researcher**: The negotiation-based approach offers a novel way to handle ambiguity in emotional cues by explicitly modeling different emotional perspectives and simulating the reasoning process that humans use to resolve conflicting information, which is a significant challenge in emotion recognition research.

- **ðŸ”¥ Red Team Critique:** This approach risks anthropomorphizing emotions and creating a system that simply mimics human-like debate without genuine understanding. The choice of negotiation protocol (argumentation, game theory) will significantly impact the outcome, and the rationale behind selecting a particular protocol needs careful justification. Furthermore, the evaluation on 'multimodal datasets with ambiguous or conflicting emotional cues' is challenging as there is no ground truth.

| Cross-Cultural Emotion Recognition                        | Develops a multi-agent system using Emotion-LLaMA and LLM agents specialized in different cultural contexts to improve emotion recognition across cultures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | 7             | 6                   | 7                     | The idea is novel in its multi-agent approach, but the Red Team correctly points out the risks of superficial cultural understanding and the difficulty in creating unbiased datasets. Justification requires a clearly defined and theoretically grounded approach to cultural representation, going beyond simply training on culture-specific data. The evaluation dataset construction needs to be rigorously addressed to avoid introducing new biases.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| Hierarchical Multi-Agent Systems for Enhanced Emotion Recognition | Designs a hierarchical MAS where Emotion-LLaMA delegates tasks to specialized LLM agents to improve contextual understanding and fine-grained emotion recognition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 8             | 6                   | 7                     | The Red Team raises concerns about complexity, overfitting, and explainability. Justification requires a clear explanation of how the specialized agents are integrated and weighted, and how the system's decisions are made explainable. The research needs to address the risk of overfitting by using appropriate regularization techniques and evaluating the model on a held-out test set. The assumption that adding more agents automatically leads to better contextual understanding needs to be validated empirically.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

**Here are the top ideas:**


## Stage 4: Final Plan

### 1. Inferred Research Field & Problem Statement

* **Inferred Field:** Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence, specifically Affective Computing and Multi-Agent Systems.
* **Problem Context:** Emotion recognition is a challenging task, especially when dealing with multimodal data that contains conflicting or ambiguous emotional cues. Current emotion recognition systems often struggle to accurately interpret these ambiguous signals, leading to errors in downstream applications such as human-computer interaction and mental health monitoring.
* **Core Challenge & Objectives:** The core challenge is to develop a robust system capable of resolving conflicting emotional cues in multimodal data by leveraging a negotiation-based multi-agent approach.
    * **Objective 1:** Design and implement a negotiation protocol, based on argumentation theory, enabling Emotion-LLaMA agents representing different emotional perspectives to exchange evidence and arguments.
    * **Objective 2:** Train Emotion-LLaMA agents to accurately recognize emotions from multimodal data and effectively participate in the negotiation process.
    * **Objective 3:** Evaluate the system's performance on multimodal datasets with ambiguous emotional cues, comparing its interpretations to human ratings of plausibility.

### 2. Detailed Proposed Methodology

* **Research Design:** Algorithm Development & Benchmarking with Human Evaluation.
* **Data & Procedures:**
    * **Data Requirements:** Multimodal datasets containing speech, facial expressions, and potentially text, annotated with emotion labels. Examples include:
        * IEMOCAP (Interactive Emotional Dyadic Motion Capture database) - widely used for speech emotion recognition.
        * CMU-MOSEI (Multimodal Opinion Sentiment and Emotion Intensity) - a large dataset with video, audio, and text.
        * A newly created dataset of synthetic multimodal data with controlled levels of emotional ambiguity, allowing for systematic testing.
    * **Execution Steps:**
        1. **Data Preparation:** Preprocess the selected datasets, including feature extraction (e.g., MFCCs for audio, facial landmark detection for video, BERT embeddings for text). Create a synthetic dataset with varied emotional overlap.
        2. **Agent Design:** Implement Emotion-LLaMA agents, each representing a different emotion (e.g., happiness, sadness, anger). Each agent is initialized with a specific emotional bias.
        3. **Negotiation Protocol Implementation:** Develop a negotiation protocol based on argumentation theory (e.g., using a dialectical argumentation system like ASPIC+). The protocol will define the rules for agents to propose claims, provide evidence, challenge claims, and retract claims. Rationale will be provided for protocol selection.
        4. **Agent Training:** Train the Emotion-LLaMA agents using a combination of supervised learning (on labeled multimodal data) and reinforcement learning (to optimize negotiation strategies). The agents should be able to map multimodal features to emotion probabilities and formulate arguments based on the evidence.
        5. **System Integration:** Integrate the Emotion-LLaMA agents and the negotiation protocol into a multi-agent system.
        6. **Evaluation:** Evaluate the system's performance on the selected datasets.
           * **Quantitative Evaluation:** Measure the system's accuracy in resolving ambiguous emotions by comparing its output to ground truth labels (where available) or to a consensus of human raters.
           * **Qualitative Evaluation:** Conduct human evaluation to assess the plausibility and coherence of the system's emotional interpretations. Participants will be presented with multimodal data and the system's interpretation and asked to rate the plausibility of the interpretation on a Likert scale.
* **Analysis & Evaluation:**
    * **Analysis Techniques:**
        * **Statistical Analysis:** Use statistical tests (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA) to compare the system's performance to baseline methods (e.g., standard emotion recognition models without negotiation).
        * **Ablation Studies:** Conduct ablation studies to evaluate the contribution of different components of the system (e.g., the negotiation protocol, the Emotion-LLaMA agents).
        * **Qualitative Analysis:** Thematic analysis of human ratings to identify patterns in the types of ambiguous emotions that the system handles well or poorly.
    * **Evaluation Metrics:**
        * **Accuracy:** Percentage of correctly classified emotions.
        * **F1-score:** Harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of accuracy.
        * **Plausibility Scores:** Average Likert scale ratings from human evaluators.
        * **Agreement Rate:** Percentage of human raters agreeing with the system's interpretation.
        * **KL Divergence:** Measure the difference between the system's predicted emotion distribution and the human-perceived emotion distribution.

### 3. Expected Outcomes & Contribution

* **Hypothesized Outcomes:** The research is expected to demonstrate that the negotiation-based multi-agent system can effectively resolve ambiguous emotions in multimodal data, achieving higher accuracy and plausibility scores compared to baseline methods. The human evaluation will provide insights into the types of ambiguous emotions that the system handles well and areas for improvement.
* **Contribution to the Field:** This research contributes to the field of Affective Computing by:
    * **Advancing the state-of-the-art in emotion recognition:** By introducing a novel negotiation-based approach for resolving ambiguous emotions.
    * **Providing a theoretical framework for modeling emotional reasoning:** By grounding the negotiation process in argumentation theory.
    * **Developing a practical system for handling ambiguous emotional cues:** Which can be used in various applications, such as human-computer interaction, mental health monitoring, and social robotics. It also builds upon the work highlighted in the ArXiv papers by offering a different approach. While the "Lotus" paper uses LLaMA to *explain* emotions to improve classification, this research uses LLaMA as *agents* that negotiate. The "Iterative Prototype Refinement" and "Dual-Constrained Dynamical Neural ODEs" papers focus on specific techniques for *modeling* ambiguity, while this research focuses on *resolving* ambiguity through a multi-agent negotiation framework. This provides a complementary approach to the problem of ambiguous emotion recognition.

**Paper: Lotus at SemEval-2025 Task 11: RoBERTa with Llama-3 Generated Explanations for Multi-Label Emotion Classification**
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for multi-label emotion detection, where Llama-3 is used to generate explanatory content that clarifies ambiguous emotional expressions, thereby enhancing RoBERTa's emotion classification performance. By incorporating explanatory context, our method improves F1-scores, particularly for emotions like fear, joy, and sadness, and outperforms text-only models. The addition of explanatory content helps resolve ambiguity, addresses challenges like overlapping emotional cues, and enhances multi-label classification, marking a significant advancement in emotion detection tasks.

**Paper: Iterative Prototype Refinement for Ambiguous Speech Emotion Recognition**
Abstract: Recognizing emotions from speech is a daunting task due to the subtlety and ambiguity of expressions. Traditional speech emotion recognition (SER) systems, which typically rely on a singular, precise emotion label, struggle with this complexity. Therefore, modeling the inherent ambiguity of emotions is an urgent problem. In this paper, we propose an iterative prototype refinement framework (IPR) for ambiguous SER. IPR comprises two interlinked components: contrastive learning and class prototypes. The former provides an efficient way to obtain high-quality representations of ambiguous samples. The latter are dynamically updated based on ambiguous labels -- the similarity of the ambiguous data to all prototypes. These refined embeddings yield precise pseudo labels, thus reinforcing representation quality. Experimental evaluations conducted on the IEMOCAP dataset validate the superior performance of IPR over state-of-the-art methods, thus proving the effectiveness of our proposed method.

**Paper: Dual-Constrained Dynamical Neural ODEs for Ambiguity-aware Continuous Emotion Prediction**
Abstract: There has been a significant focus on modelling emotion ambiguity in recent years, with advancements made in representing emotions as distributions to capture ambiguity. However, there has been comparatively less effort devoted to the consideration of temporal dependencies in emotion distributions which encodes ambiguity in perceived emotions that evolve smoothly over time. Recognizing the benefits of using constrained dynamical neural ordinary differential equations (CD-NODE) to model time series as dynamic processes, we propose an ambiguity-aware dual-constrained Neural ODE approach to model the dynamics of emotion distributions on arousal and valence. In our approach, we utilize ODEs parameterised by neural networks to estimate the distribution parameters, and we integrate additional constraints to restrict the range of the system outputs to ensure the validity of predicted distributions. We evaluated our proposed system on the publicly available RECOLA dataset and observed very promising performance across a range of evaluation metrics.
