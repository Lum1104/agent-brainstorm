A client-side AI agent system that runs entirely in your browser, utilizing Google's Gemini API to facilitate structured brainstorming sessions through multiple AI personas.

## Overview

This system implements a 5-stage brainstorming methodology using AI agents to generate, evaluate, and refine ideas for both project development and research papers. The entire process runs locally in your browser with no server-side dependencies.

## Features

### ðŸ¤– Multi-Agent Architecture
- **Preview Agent**: Assembles expert teams with distinct personas
- **RAG Agent**: Provides contextual research and background information
- **Ideation Agents**: Generate diverse ideas from different perspectives
- **Critic Agent**: Evaluates and ranks generated ideas
- **Expert Agent**: Creates detailed implementation plans

### ðŸ“‹ Two Brainstorming Modes
1. **Project Ideas**: For products, features, and development projects
2. **Research Papers**: For academic topics, studies, and research questions

### ðŸ”„ 5-Stage Workflow
1. **Define Direction & Assemble Team**: Configure personas based on your topic
2. **Context via RAG Agent**: Gather relevant background information
3. **Divergent Ideation**: Generate multiple ideas from different perspectives
4. **Convergent Evaluation**: Analyze, cluster, and rank ideas
5. **Final Document Generation**: Create detailed plans for selected ideas

- Evaluates each concept on multiple criteria
- Provides detailed justifications
- Ranks the top 3 recommendations

### Step 6: Implementation Planning
Select one of the top ideas to generate:
- **For Projects**: Implementation plan with requirements, tech stack, timeline, and resources
- **For Research**: Research outline with methodology, literature review, and publication targets

## Example Use Cases
